# Lab 04: Satisfiability Modulo Theories

During this lab you will be using the Z3 solver to deduce facts and solve combinatorial problems.

### Setup the coding environment

For this lab, you can use the virtual environment `iap` which contains all the packages that we will use throughout the entire course.

~~~
    conda activate iap
~~~

If you won't use Anaconda you can create a virtual environment by hand or using any other virtual environment manager (see [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python!](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) for details), taking the list of required packages from [environment.yaml](https://ole.unibz.it/mod/page/view.php?id=171313).

- For this assignment you should work in the `smt` folder.

## Exercises

The description of the exercises is provided in the `SMT.ipynb` document within the `smt` folder. You could write your solutions directly within the document. You can also include additional support code in external files to ease the writing of the notebook (it's often better to factorize complex code outside the notebooks for maintainability).

## Submission

Write a `SOLUTION.md` file in the `smt` folder describing your code and how to use it (the format is a lightweight markup language called [Markdown](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/help/user/markdown.md)), then push your solution to the GitLab server.

You should thoroughly describe your code and the results of your evaluation. If you prefer to keep a small `SOLUTION.md` file, you can also include a separate documentation file using the format you prefer (e.g. a Jupyter notebook)

This lab will not be part of the evaluation!
